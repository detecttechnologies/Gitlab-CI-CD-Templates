# Troubleshooting Guide for T-pulse CI/CD Pipeline

This document provides a troubleshooting guide for common issues that might be encountered when working with the T-pulse CI/CD pipeline.

[TOC]

## Debugging CI/CD Pipeline Scripts

To debug the scripts in your CI/CD pipeline, you can use the `set -x` command in your script section of the job. This will print each command before it's executed, along with the results. This can help you identify the root cause of any issues.

## CI/CD Pipeline Fails on Docker Build

If the pipeline fails during the Docker build stage, it might be due to issues with the Dockerfile or missing dependencies. To troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the Dockerfile for any syntax errors or missing dependencies.
2. Check the GitLab CI/CD pipeline logs for any error messages related to the Docker build stage.
3. Run the Docker build command locally to see if you can replicate the issue.

## CI/CD Pipeline Fails on NPM Run Build

If the pipeline fails during the `npm run build` stage, it might be due to issues with the build script or missing dependencies. To troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the build script for any syntax errors or missing dependencies.
2. Check the GitLab CI/CD pipeline logs for any error messages related to the `npm run build` stage.
3. Run the `npm run build` command locally to see if you can replicate the issue.

## CI/CD Pipeline Fails on Deployment

If the pipeline fails during the deployment stage, it might be due to issues with the deployment configuration or infrastructure. To troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the deployment configuration for any syntax errors or missing variables.
2. Check the GitLab CI/CD pipeline logs for any error messages related to the deployment stage.
3. Verify that the infrastructure (ECR, ECS, EC2, etc.) is properly set up and configured.

## CI/CD Pipeline Fails on Test Stage

If the pipeline fails during the test stage, it might be due to issues with the test scripts or failing test cases. To troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the test scripts for any syntax errors or missing dependencies.
2. Check the GitLab CI/CD pipeline logs for any error messages related to the test stage.
3. Run the test scripts locally to see if you can replicate the issue and identify the failing test cases.

## Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables

If the pipeline fails due to missing or incorrect environment variables, ensure that the required variables are properly set in the CI/CD settings or the `.toml` config file for each environment. Some of the required variables include:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- EC2_IP_ADDRESS
- SSH_PRIVATE_KEY

Verify that the values for these variables are correct and have the necessary permissions to access the required services.
