title: ADR-0004: Creating a Single Environment for All Clients
description: Decision to create a single environment for all clients in the T-pulse CI/CD pipeline and deploy updates simultaneously for better efficiency

# Context and Problem Statement

The T-pulse project has multiple clients, each requiring deployments of updates and new features. Managing separate environments and deployment processes for each client can become complex and time-consuming. We need an efficient and manageable way to deploy updates to all clients while maintaining stability and reducing potential errors.

# Considered Options

* Option 1: Creating separate environments for each client and deploying updates individually
  * Pros:
    * Allows for selective deployment to specific clients
    * Easier to isolate and fix issues related to a single client's deployment
  * Cons:
    * Requires separate deployment configuration files for each client
    * Increases complexity and management overhead
* Option 2: Creating a single environment for all clients and deploying updates simultaneously
  * Pros:
    * Simplifies the deployment process, making it easier to manage
    * Reduces the time and effort needed for deployments
    * Ensures consistency across client deployments
    * Better resource utilization
  * Cons:
    * Deployment configuration file can become long and harder to manage

# Decision Outcome and Reason

* Chosen option: Option 2 - Creating a single environment for all clients and deploying updates simultaneously
* Reason over other options: 
  - Despite the drawbacks of a longer deployment configuration file and the inability to deploy updates selectively, Option 2 offers better manageability and efficiency.
  - Creating a single environment for all clients simplifies the deployment process, reduces the time and effort needed for deployments, and ensures consistency across client deployments. 
  - Specific client deployments can be controlled by modifying the client configuration to only include a particular subset of clients.
  - Additionally, this method allows for better resource utilization and reduces the chances of inconsistencies and errors that may occur with separate environments and deployment processes.
